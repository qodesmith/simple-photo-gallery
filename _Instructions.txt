PHOTO GALLERY CSS AND JAVASCRIPT TEST INSTRUCTIONS

Please build the photo gallery illustrated in the PSD/JPG included with this test. The results should work in all major standard browsers and should incorporate presentation layer best practices. Use your creativity to bring this UI to life!

1. The JSON data must come from an Ajax call made to the file "gallery_json.js".

2. All photo data for the gallery test must come from the JSON object.

3. Once the JSON has been loaded, the first photo and all thumbnails should appear.

4. The Album name should be displayed at the top, using the correct font.

5. Clicking on a thumbnail photo will display the corresponding larger photo.

6. When a thumbnail is selected it should be highlighted.

7. When a photo slide is shown, the title, date and location must appear below it.

8. Clicking on the arrows will go to the next or previous photo.

9. Please make your photo gallery look as close as possible to the mockup.


Feel free to use any frameworks or libraries you like.
